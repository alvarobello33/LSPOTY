## 🐳 Running the Project with Docker

The project was developed with **CodeIgniter** inside **Docker** containers, and its execution is managed via **Docker Compose**.

### Steps to run the project:

1. Install and open Docker Desktop.

2. Change filename from `env` to `.env` for both configuration files located in: `pwii-lspoty-environment/` and `pwii-lspoty-environment/www/`

3. *(Optional)* Modify the container ports in the `.env` file according to your configuration (it is recommended to keep the default ones unless they are already in use).

3. In the terminal, navigate to the project’s root folder `pwii-lspoty-environment`.

4. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker compose build app

5. Start the containers:
   ```bash
    docker compose up -d
6. Install the project dependencies (CodeIgniter / Composer):
    ```bash
    docker compose exec app composer install
7.  Open the project in your browser:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:4080/
    (Or from Docker Desktop, by opening the nginx container.)
